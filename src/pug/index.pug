During the work, we also could not forget the requirements that the B2B sales market brings. The standard Magento 2 functionalities available in Scandi PWA were extended to include mechanisms typical of B2B, such as subaccounts or the ability to import a shopping cart.

After few years, after the change of e-commerce director, MAC decided to change the e-commerce platform to IAI-Shop (current IdoSell). The change in technology resulted in the cooperation not being continued. After another few years, another change of e-commerce manager and in parallel with the ERP system being implemented into the company, it was decided to implement the new e-commerce platform again on Magento, this time in version 2. The simultaneous implementation of the ERP system, e-commerce system and integration was possible thanks to the full involvement of the IT director on the MAC side in both projects. He was the person who combined knowledge of the processes inside the company, their mapping in the newly created systems and the interrelationships of these systems. Integration of the systems included full synchronization of product information (enriched by marketing on the e-commerce platform), prices, inventories, contractors with individual terms of trade, orders, deliveries.

Although it is an e-commerce platform, the number of dedicated solutions specific to the company was so high that we decided to build a solution from scratch, also based on the Symfony framework. Vue.js is responsible for the frontend part. The decision to implement a separate mobile version of the system was dictated by a number of factors, including the desire to provide two separate e-commerce systems that would constitute a single Single Point o Failure. The implemented solution is independent of the original desktop system so that customers have the ability to use e-commerce even in the event of problems that may occur on one of the systems.
